# The Vision
Attestations can be used for so much. This is both a benefit and a challenge. If we're successful, where will they take us?

## A Trustful Tomorrow

What does it feel like to trust today? Imagine you're at a your favorite city market. You recognize a few faces, shake hands with local vendors, and exchange stories with neighbors. There's a sense of community, a shared trust. You know who grows the best tomatoes, who bakes the freshest bread. It's all based on experience, recommendations, and genuine interactions relative to you. That's our real-world trust.

Now, think about our online world. It's like stepping into a massive global market. Faces are hidden behind screens, and every interaction feels like a gamble. Can you trust that online review? Is that seller genuine? Today, it's like navigating a maze without a map. That's our digital trust challenge.

But what if our online world felt more like that local market? Where you could recognize and trust digital "faces", not because of a platform's algorithm, but because of genuine, verifiable interactions that you care about. That's the power of attestations.

With attestations, we're not just adding a digital signature. We're giving every individual and business the tools to decide who they trust, what they trust, how they trust, and why. It's about creating a sense of "relative trust" online and giving users the choice. Just like you trust your neighbor's recommendation for the best bakery, in the digital space, you could trust a content creator because of genuine interactions and verified claims. This world doesn't have a universal trust score. Those make no sense. 

And here's where Ethereum and EAS come into play. They're not just building a digital infrastructure; they're crafting the very pathways of this new trust. It's like laying down roads in our digital market, making it easier for everyone to find their way, to recognize genuine merchants from the fleeting ones.

But, like every market, it's the community that truly defines it. And that's where you come in. To build this vision, to make our digital interactions as genuine as our real-world ones, we need you. Whether you're a developer, a content creator, or just someone who believes in a trustworthy digital future, your voice, your trust, your interaction matters.

So, let's come together. Let's make our online world a place where trust is built on genuine interactions, where every individual has the power to decide their trust. Let's make our digital market as familiar, as trustworthy, as our local one.

Together, let's shape a future where trust is, once again, at the heart of every interaction.

## The First Steps Towards Our Vision
Our journey starts now. But how do we transition from what is to what could be?

### Immediate Challenges:
- **Fragmented Trust:** Today, trust is scattered across platforms, each with its own standards and algorithms. This fragmentation makes it hard to have a consistent trust experience.
- **Over-reliance on Centralized Systems:** Centralized platforms hold a lot of power over our data and interactions. They decide who and what to trust, often based on profit motives rather than genuine interactions.

### The EAS Standard:
- **Unified Trust Framework:** EAS provides a standardized way to create and verify attestations, making trust more consistent across platforms.
- **Empowering Individuals & Builders:** With EAS, every individual gets to decide their trust parameters. You're not just a passive consumer; you're an active participant in shaping your digital trust landscape.

### Opportunities Ahead:
- **For Impact-Driven Individuals:** Dive into the world of attestations. Understand them, advocate for them, and help shape a future where trust is democratized.
- **For Profit-Driven Entities:** Recognize the potential of a trust-driven ecosystem. Build solutions that leverage the power of attestations, offering genuine value to users and reaping the rewards of a trust-centric business model.

## Let's get started
The future is in our hands. It's up to us to shape it. Start by understanding the power of attestations. Integrate them into your platforms, advocate for their adoption, and be a part of the community that's redefining digital trust.

Join us in this journey. Let's make the digital world as trustworthy as our favorite local market.
