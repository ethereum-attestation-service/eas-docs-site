# Beyond Privacy
*It's easy to think zk is really meant for privacy use cases. It's also incredibly helpful to think about for scalability of attestation apps that need scalability in a trustless way.*

Most conversations stop at “ZK = hide stuff.”
Cool, but hiding is only chapter one. Chapter two is where ZK turns your attestation system into a lightweight, cross-chain, ultra-cheap machine.

Think of proofs as zip files for trust: stuff a pile of signatures, checks, or external API calls into one succinct blob; pay a flat verify cost; send that blob anywhere.

Let’s unpack how to do that.

## 1. Reframe how you think about ZK
*A mental gear-shift before you code.*

| Old reflex                                              | New reflex                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “I need ZK so users can keep their birth date private.” | “I need ZK so 10k birthdate checks cost the price of one.”          |
| “Proofs belong on the edge (client ↔ server).”          | “Proofs are also a great *compression codec* between chains and contracts.” |
| “Attestations = gas-heavy storage.”                     | “Attestations = **hashes + proofs**; state stays tiny.”                     |

## 2. ZK Tricks to Slash Cost & State
*Four primitives you’ll mix-and-match.*

| Trick                             | 10-second explainer                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Batch verify**                  | Off-chain worker checks *N* credentials, emits **one** proof that “they’re all legit.” Gas   stays constant.                  |
| **Recursive / aggregated proofs** | Stack smaller proofs into one parent; Solidity verifies a single curve pairing.                                               |
| **zkVMs**                         | Write normal Rust / C / Wasm, then prove the whole program ran correctly.  Signature checks, API calls—whatever.              |
| **Proof-of-state**                | Prove a specific storage slot (e.g., EAS UID) exists on Chain A; consume on Chain B—no bridge multisig, no duplicate storage. |

>**Senior dev rule:** If a loop in Solidity hits 30+ ECDSA sigs or 250 k+ gas, ask “Could one proof do this cheaper?”

## 3. Open Source Tools You Should Use
*Pick one per layer, prototype, move on.*

| Layer                         | OSS options (battle-tested)                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **zkVMs**                     | Risc 0 ▪︎ SP1 ▪︎ zkWASM                    |
| **Proof aggregators**         | Halo2 recursion ▪︎ SnarkPack               |
| **Onchain coprocessors**     | Axiom ▪︎ Succinct Telepathy                |
| **Superchain L2 Inbox** | Native cross-L2 log relay (no extra proof) |


##  4. Design Pattern Examples
*Concrete flows to help you brainstorm how to apply zk to attestation scalability.*

| **Pattern**                         | **Flow **                                                                                                                      | **Typical win**                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Batch verifier**                  | Offchain worker checks 8k KYC JWTs, emits one Groth16 proof, contract mints a single EAS “verified-customer” UID.                        | 99 % gas cut for onboarding.                    |
| **Proof-of-reserves**               | Custodian’s zkVM reads exchange DB, proves “assets ≥ liabilities,” posts proof + hash to EAS; DeFi money-market contract trusts result.      | Auditable reserves without leaking wallets.     |
| **Reputation snapshot**             | Aggregator scores 40k GitHub commits, produces one proof of contributor points, DAO contract writes EAS reputation attestations for voters. | 100× cheaper voter-weight updates.              |
| **Supply-chain authenticity batch** | WiFi IoT devices sign bandwidth consumption IDs; nightly job batches signatures, posts zk proof + one EAS “lot-verified” UID.                              | Full traceability without chain bloat.          |
| **Game leaderboard roll-up**        | Game server rolls daily scores into a zk root, publishes root to L2, contract mints season trophies from root instead of per-score writes.   | Gas-free high-score tracking for 100 k players. |
| **On-demand risk check**            | DeFi vault queries coprocessor: “Prove user leverage < 5×,” receives proof, caches pass/fail in onchain EAS UID.                            | Heavy math paid only when user acts.            |

> The theme: batch first, prove once, store tiny.


## 5. When Not to ZK-Scale
- < 50 attestations per month → cheaper to verify raw.
- Need < 3 s UX on mobile and can’t stream progress.
- Data already tiny (hash fits in calldata) and public.

> Rule: Batch size × gas saved > proof cost? If no, skip the ZK.

## Closing Thoughts
ZK does privacy, but it unlocks scale.
Batch, prove, anchor the UID in EAS so future contracts just read a single hash. Your users pay less, blockspace stays lean, and other builders can compose on top without re-running proofs.
