# Credible Neutrality
In an era where biases and hidden agendas often skew digital platforms, the principle of "Credible Neutrality" stands as a testament to genuine fairness and trustworthiness. It's a foundational requirement for systems that aim to earn unwavering trust.

## What is Credible Neutrality?
`Credible Neutrality` is the commitment of a system to operate without favoring any participant, agenda, or outcome. It's a promise that the platform's operations are transparent, unbiased, and free from external influences. Email is a great example and mental model of a protocol that is credibly neutral. You know that email won't be captured by some for-profit entity. Anyone can build on it and use it for their own purposes.

## Why It Matters
Consider a world where every digital interaction is tinged with doubt. Is this person real? Is this platform suppressing certain voices? What happens if I click this link? Credible Neutrality makes things a bit more:

- **Trustful:** Users can confidently interact with systems, knowing there are no hidden agendas or rent extraction.
- **Fair:** A neutral platform ensures everyone has an equal opportunity, fostering genuine innovation.
- **Resilient:** Systems built on neutrality are robust against manipulation, ensuring reliability.

## EAS Embodies Credible Neutrality
EAS provides a platform that doesn't play favorites. Every attestation, every interaction, is treated with the same level of impartiality. The code has been refactored so many times to not presuppose how it will be used or who will use it, giving everyone a fair shot to build amazing things on top of it.

Credible Neutrality is a core strength required to become a standard. Anyone can copy open-source code, but it's the community's trust in its neutrality that makes it unique and irreplaceable.

## Centralization & Tokens != Credible Neutrality
### Centralization: The Single Point of Bias
Centralization, by its very nature, concentrates power and control within a single entity or a select group. This concentration introduces:
- **Potential for Bias:** A centralized authority can, intentionally or unintentionally, favor certain participants or outcomes over others.
- **Opaque Decisions:** With centralized control, it's challenging to ensure that decisions are made transparently and for the collective good.
- **Vulnerability:** Centralized systems can become single points of failure, both technically and ethically.

### Tokens: The Double-Edged Sword
While tokens can incentivize participation and growth in a platform, they can also introduce challenges:

- **Profit over Purpose:** The drive to increase a token's value can overshadow the platform's primary purpose, leading to decisions that prioritize profit over neutrality.
- **Unintended Barriers:** Token-based systems can inadvertently create barriers to entry, where only those holding or willing to invest in the token can fully participate.
- **Speculation Over Utility:** The focus can shift from the platform's utility to the speculative value of the token, detracting from the platform's core mission.

## Wrapping Up
Credible Neutrality is a necessity for digital systems aiming for genuine trust. EAS, rooted in this principle, ensures its position as a trusted entity in the attestation landscape.
