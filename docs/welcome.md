# Welcome to EAS 

## 👋 Introduction
**Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** is the global base layer for registering and creating [Attestations](/docs/learn/attestations). EAS is a free open-source, decentralized, composable, permissionless, tokenless, **public good** built on Ethereum.

EAS helps people verify things in a trustless way. There are a lot of different ways to prove who you are, what you have, and what you know. Each one is good for different things, but attestations typically don't work together or can be verified in a trustless way. EAS is a way to make all attestations work together so that you can use them for anything you need.

 ``` "Not your keys, not your attestation". ``` 

### 🌎 The Global Registry for Attestations
There are several existing tailor-made on-chain solutions for identity, verifications, claims, and cryptographic proofs. Each of these innovations are essential building blocks for specific use cases and communities, but each tailor-made protocol increases fragmentation and limits composability. 

EAS introduces and serves as the base layer where all attestors and innovators can coordinate, create, register, and compose unique attestation schemas.

### 🔓 EAS is an open-source, free, and permissonless public good
EAS is built by the community and for the community while holding the original promsises of blockchain true:

- **open-source**, meaning anyone can use it.
- **decentralized**, meaning it is not owned by any one person or company, but supported by the ETH community.
- **tokenless**, as all transactions are settled with Ethereum.
- a **public good**, meaning it is free to use and created for the greater good of the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **composable**, meaning attestations can be built like lego blocks on top of each other and with each other.
- **permissionless**, meaning you do not need permission from a centralized entity, person, or group to use EAS. 

### 🚄 Elegantly simple smart contracts
EAS runs on two elegant and simple smart contracts. One for [**registering attestation Schemas**](docs/technical--docs/contracts), and another to [**attest with them**](docs/technical--docs/contracts). Schemas can be registered for any use case and attestations can be done on-chain or off-chain.

In addition, we provide a resolver contract for advanced use cases, such as on-chain verification of attestation data, and also attaching payments to attestations (which makes a new suite of powerful web3 applications possible).


### 🧱 EAS does not presuppose anything.
EAS is a primitive base layer. It does not presuppose anything such as the correct schema structure for a use case. It is designed to be a foundation that can be used to build more specific and complex systems on top of it and can be tailored to fit the needs of different users. This primitive layer will enable the freedom to create and reinforce the **right schemas** and attestations for the **right use cases** for the **right users** overtime. 

## ✨ Why EAS exists.

Our `purpose` is to be the global base layer where anything and everything is attested to on-chain.

Our `vision` is that EAS enables new economic, democratic, and decentralized ecosystems that create a better world for future generations.

Our `mission` is to bring as many attestations on-chain. 
 The EAS team's mission is to attract and coordinate the most promising developers and innovators passionate about simple verifications & trustless economies, in order to bring as many attestations on-chain as possible.

We `stand` for the early promises and values of blockchain. EAS will always be open-source, permissionless, tokenless, composable, transparent, and community-owned.

We’ve `built` the base layer. It’s up to **all** of us to create the future.
