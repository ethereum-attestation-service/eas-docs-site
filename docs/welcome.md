# Welcome to EAS

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
**Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** is a public good that enables anyone to make [attestations](/docs/learn/attestations) on or off-chain about anything. You simply register a schema (or use an existing one) about any topic and make attestations using that schema. 

In order to decentralize more than money and assets there needs to be a generic ledger for making statements on Ethereum. This ledger will help establish more trust across our online interactions. Anytime you need to prove or verify something, attestations will play a critical role. By allowing anyone to create and validate attestations, EAS has the potential to transform how information is shared and verified online and throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.

EAS is a public good, available for anyone to use and build upon. It aims to create a common layer for attestations that can be used and integrated by a variety of different applications and protocols. This will enable the creation of a universal, open-source layer for attestations that can be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of information across different systems and communities.

We're excited to see what you'll build with EAS, and we can't wait to see how you'll use attestations to create a more trustful and transparent world. 

### ðŸŒŽ ðŸŒŽ The Global Registry for Attestations
EAS serves as the base layer for coordinating, creating, and registering unique attestation schemas. This allows for interoperability and composability between various attestation protocols and solutions, enabling the attestation layer to evolve over time.

### ðŸ”“ Free, tokenless, open-source, and permissionless
EAS is an open-source, permissionless platform, available for anyone to use and contribute to its development. EAS is built by and for the community, upholding the original promises of blockchain.

- **open-source**, meaning anyone can use it.
- **decentralized**, meaning it is not owned by any one person or company, but supported by the ETH community.
- **tokenless**, as all transactions are settled with Ethereum.
- a **public good**, meaning it is free to use and created for the greater good of the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **interoperable**, meaning different parts of the attestation layer can work together smoothly.
- **composable**, meaning attestations can be added and built like lego blocks on top of each other and with each other.
- **permissionless**, meaning you do not need permission from a centralized entity, person, or group to use EAS. 

### ðŸ§± EAS does not presuppose anything
EAS is a primitive base layer that does not make assumptions about how it will be used or the appropriate schema structure for a particular use case. It is designed to be a foundation that can be used to build more specific and complex systems on top of it and can be tailored to fit the needs of different users. This primitive layer will enable the freedom to create and reinforce the right schemas and attestations for the right use cases for the right users over time.

### ðŸš„ Elegantly simple smart contracts
EAS runs on two simple smart contracts: one for [**registering attestation Schemas**](technical--docs/contracts) and another for [**attesting with them**](technical--docs/contracts). Schemas can be registered for any use case, and attestations can be made on-chain or off-chain. You can also add a resolver contract to the Schema for advanced use cases, such as on-chain verification of attestation data and attaching payments to attestations.

## ðŸ’¡What you can build with EAS.
EAS allows for a wide range of possibilities for entrepreneurs and developers to build applications that make use of attestations. Some examples of what can be built with EAS include identity verification systems, supply chain solutions, and credentialing systems, and more. We're excited to see what you'll build with EAS and how you'll use attestations to create a more trustful and transparent world.

Check out this [**ever-growing list of use cases**](/docs/category/use-cases) that can be built with EAS. 

## âœ¨ Why EAS exists.
EAS exists to build more trust online. EAS aims to be the global base layer where anything and everything can be attested to. Our vision is to create a world where trust is restored and increased through a global, open, and interoperable attestation layer.

We believe that by creating a free and open-source platform for attestations, we can foster innovation and enable people to verify and trust each other in a more efficient and transparent way. Join us and help build the global attestation layer for the Ethereum ecosystem.

## ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started
We're excited to see what you build with EAS. Let's get started!

1. Read the documentation to [**learn more about attestations**](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/category/learn) and how to use EAS.
2. Explore and [**install our SDK**](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/getting--started/javascript) to easily integrate into a Javascript/Typescript project 
3. Explore the [**registry of attestation schemas**](https://easscan.org/schemas) and see what is available.
4. Register your [**own attestation schemas**](https://easscan.org/schema/create) using the EAS smart contracts or UI.
5. Use the EAS attestation service to [**create and verify attestations**](https://easscan.com/attestations) for any purpose.

## ðŸ¤— Join the Community
EAS is built by the community and for the community. You can join the community and contribute to the project by:
