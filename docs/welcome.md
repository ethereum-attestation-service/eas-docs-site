# Welcome to EAS 
![EAS Banner](/img/eas-twitter-banner-v2.png)

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome.
**Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** is an open-source infrastructure public good for making attestations onchain or offchain. 

How do you decide who and what to trust? Our online and onchain worlds are filled with both genuine and deceptive information. We need a common way we can trust the authenticity of information and safety of our interactions. Anytime you need to prove or verify something, attestations will play a critical role. 

EAS is a standard and base layer where any entity can make attestations about anything. This primitive and ledger of attestations will help us decentralize more than just money and assets. We'll be able to coordinate and build reputation systems, voting systems, governance systems, decentralized social media, provenance of goods, knowledge and social graphs, and much much more. 

We're excited to see what you'll build with EAS, and we can't wait to see how you'll use attestations to create a more trustful and transparent world.

## Why Attestations Matter
:::info
At its core, attestations are simply digital signatures on a structured pieces of information.
:::

In the age of misinformation - verifying facts, proving the authenticity and trustworthiness of information become critical. In our offline worlds, people attest to things all the time. A notary attests that you signed a document, a doctor attests to your health, a university attests to your diploma, you attest to the post and likes you make on social media, a bank attests you're qualified for a loan, and even your friends attest that they like you or that they trust you. The interactions are endless. However there is no universal and standard way for making attestations online or onchain.

At the heart of every interaction, whether it's a financial transaction or a simple online conversation, trust is essential. EAS enables anyone to make [attestations](/docs/core--concepts/attestations) onchain or offchain about anything. You simply register a schema (or use an existing one) about any topic and make attestations referencing that schema. 

We believe that by creating a free and open-source platform for attestations, we can foster innovation and enable people to verify and trust each other in a more efficient and transparent way. Join us and help build the global attestation layer for the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Key Things to Know About EAS
### âœ¨ The architecture is elegantly simple.
EAS runs on [two simple smart contracts](/docs/core--concepts/how-eas-works): one for **registering attestation Schemas** and another for **attesting with them**. Schemas can be registered for any use case, and attestations can be made onchain or offchain. You can also add a resolver contract to the Schema for advanced use cases, such as onchain verification of attestation data and attaching payments to attestations.

### ðŸ”“ We don't presuppose anything.
EAS doesn't box you in with presumptions. Instead, it offers a base layer that's adaptable to myriad applications and does not make assumptions about how it will be used or the appropriate schema structure for a particular use case. It is designed to be a foundation that can be used to build more specific and complex systems on top of it and can be tailored to fit the needs of different users. This primitive layer will enable the freedom to create and reinforce the right schemas and attestations for the right use cases for the right users over time.

### ðŸ™Œ  EAS is a public good.
EAS is an open-source, permissionless, tokenless, and free-to-use software. It's built by the community for the community. As a public good, we've opted for impact over profit. We realized that when you are building something so atomic for trust and identity, it's imperative that someone with a bigger budget can't manipulate the protocol or community for their own financial gain. Trust and money are like oil and water. To become a standard, we need to keep value extractors away from value creators at the protocol layer. It must be credibly neutral. Anyone has the ability to build for-profit businesses on top of the protocol that leverages attestations.

### ðŸ’¡ Attestations aren't tokens.
It's a new primitive. While tokens represent a type of digital asset, EAS attestations are fundamentally different. The primary purpose of EAS is to serve as a protocol that facilitates the creation of digital signatures on structured information, enhancing both their composability and interoperability, trust, and validation. You can build your own UIs for attestation data or even generate NFTs or different ERCs based on attestations.

### ðŸ§  Think beyond identity.
The identity ecosystem is extremely fragmented and a key reason why EAS was built, however, its flexibility lends itself to build trust beyond identity. EAS is not an identity provider. EAS allows for a wide range of possibilities for entrepreneurs and developers to build applications that make use of attestations. Some examples of what can be built with EAS include reputation systems, provenance of information or assets, voting & governance systems, registries, social graphs, and more. We're excited to see what you'll build with EAS and how you'll use attestations to create a more trustful and transparent world.

Get inspired with a few [**thought starters!**](/docs/idea--zone/thought-starters.md) 

## Start Building
We're excited to see what you build with EAS. Let's get started!

1. Read the documentation to [**learn more about attestations**](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/category/core-concepts) and how to use EAS.
2. [**Install the SDK**](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/developer-tools/eas-sdk) to easily integrate into a JavaScript/TypeScript project.
3. Create your own [**indexer**](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-indexing-service) for easily indexing attestation data.
4. Query your attestations with the [**GraphQL API**](/docs/developer-tools/api) using the EAS smart contracts or UI.
5. Use the EAS to [**create and verify attestations**](https://easscan.com/attestations) for any purpose.
